# STRONGMAN

## Overview

Strongman was created to support my best friend, who shattered his leg in a motorcycle accident this past year. As an avid powerlifter, he expressed a strong desire to resume lifting and was concerned about the weight he gained while confined to a hospital bed for over a month.

## Project Purpose

The goal of Strongman is to aid his recovery by providing tools that facilitate his rehabilitation journey.

## Features

AI-Embedded Chatbot: Utilizing OpenAI's GPT API, this chatbot offers general dietary advice and healthy recipes, complete with nutrition facts, to assist in his recovery.

Lifting Log: A dedicated feature for tracking workouts as he begins weightlifting again during physical therapy.

## Future Plans

I aim to develop a mobile version of this project for broader accessibility.

## Status

This project is still under development.
